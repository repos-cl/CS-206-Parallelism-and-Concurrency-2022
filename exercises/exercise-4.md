# Exercise 4
## Problem 1: Implementing `map` and `filter` on Futures

In this exercise, you will come up with an implementation of the `map` and `filter` methods of `MyFuture`. The `MyFuture` trait is a simplified version of the `Future` trait from the Scala standard library, with a single abstract method:

```scala
trait MyFuture[+T]:
  def onComplete(callback: Try[T] => Unit): Unit
```

First of all, spend some time as a group to make sure that you understand what those methods are supposed to do. Then, complete the following code to implement the two methods:

```scala
extension [T](self: MyFuture[T])
  def map[S](f: T => S): MyFuture[S] = ???
  def filter(p: T => Boolean): MyFuture[T] = ???
```

In the case of `filter`, if the original `MyFuture` successfully returns a value which does not satisfy the predicate, the new `MyFuture` should return a `Failure` containing a `NoSuchElementException`.

## Problem 2: Coordinator / Worker

In this exercise, you will implement a Coordinator / Worker actor system, in which one actor, the coordinator, dispatches work to other actors, the workers. Between the coordinator and the workers, only two kinds of messages are sent: `Request` and `Ready` messages.

```scala
enum Message:
    case Request(computation: () => Unit)
    case Ready
```

<details>
  <summary><em>Note:</em> <code>enum</code> syntax</summary>

Enumerations are the Scala 3 idiomatic syntax to define algebraic data
types (ADTs). The code below is desugared to something equivalent to:

```scala
trait Message
case class Request(computation: () => Unit) extends Message
object Ready extends Message
```

which is the syntax used in the lecture videos.

The coordinator actor sends `Request` messages to workers to request them to perform some computation (passed as an argument of `Request`). Upon reception of a `Request`, a worker should perform the computation. Workers should send a `Ready` message to their coordinator whenever they finish executing the requested computation, and also right after they are created.

The coordinator actor itself receives requests through `Request` messages from clients. The coordinator actor should then dispatch the work to worker actors. The coordinator should however never send a request to a worker which has not declared itself ready via a `Ready` message beforehand.

Implement the `Coordinator` and `Worker` classes.

```scala
class Coordinator extends Actor:
  ???
  override def receive = ???

class Worker(coordinator: Coordinator) extends Actor:
  ???
  override def receive = ???
```

An example system using the `Coordinator` and `Worker` actors is shown below.

```scala
@main def problem2 = new TestKit(ActorSystem("coordinator-workers")) with ImplicitSender:
  try
    val coordinator = system.actorOf(Props(Coordinator()), "coordinator")
    val workers = Seq.tabulate(4)(i =>
      system.actorOf(Props(Worker(coordinator)), f"worker$i")
    )

    // Now, clients should be able to send requests to the coordinatorâ€¦
    coordinator ! Request(() => println(3 + 5))
    coordinator ! Request(() => println(67 * 3))
    // And so on...
  finally shutdown(system)

```

*Hint*: In order to fulfill its job, the coordinator should remember which workers are ready and what requests are still to be allocated to a worker.
